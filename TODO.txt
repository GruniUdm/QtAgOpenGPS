To do

1. ~~ABLine and Contour line UI stuff out of the GL drawing function.~~ (pretty sure that was done a long time ago)
2. ~~Move section lookahead stuff out of GL drawing functinone somehow.
   Maybe after rendering frame, save a pixmap of the entire widget.~~ (done a long time ago)
3. Create the "Top Field View"/"Grid Rotate" window
4. Finish out the "Steer Settings" Pages.
 * Anyone working on this, please keep your branch up-do-date with David's "dev" branch, as he will be working on this in there
 * FormSteerWiz.cs see btnStartSA_Click, btnStartSA_Left_Click, Timer1_Tick
   * Everything can be done in javascript and qml, accessing settings, and some other properties in aog, vehicleInterface, etc. Anything else we need will have to be brought in.
5. Add "Auto reconnect" to UDP code in QtAgIO.
7. Finish the reset logic in 'reset_all' in SteerConfigSettings.qml
8. ~~IsAutoSteerBtnOn~~ (done)
